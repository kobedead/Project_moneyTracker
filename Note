In CreateTicketPanel, you need selected person from CreatePersonPanel , and all created persons.
Now  i just give CreatePersonPanel to CreateTicketPanel, but idk if thats bad practice

So i made vieuwframe a listner for selectedPerson , but then i need to store this in CreateTicketPanel wich increases space of object
if i just give CreatePersonPanel i dont increase pace that much cause its a refrence
